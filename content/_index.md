Welcome to my page — I invite you to explore my teaching, scholarly activity, research areas, and projects.


## Biography

I have nearly a decade of teaching experience with undergraduate and graduate students, starting from my home country Iran and continuing in Canada. I am currently a Faculty Member at Yorkville University. I am also pursuing a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) in Business Analytics at George Fox University in Portland, Oregon.

I hold an MA in Economics from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and an MSc in Economics and Social Systems Engineering from the Institute for Management and Planning Studies in Tehran. The combination of my economics and business background has given me a strong foundation and a broader way of looking at events and decisions. It helps me approach situations with multiple lenses and perspectives when analyzing what is happening.

## Coding and Technical Projects

I love coding and creating meaningful outputs through code. Earlier, I used to code fully on my own, and now with advancements in tools like ChatGPT, I often do more “vibe coding.” With these newer tools, working with software and building technical solutions has become even more enjoyable and creative for me.

Here is my GitHub page with some of the projects I have worked on:

My interest in coding connects closely with another passion of mine — working with business and economic data to discover meaning, relationships, and interpretation. I enjoy analyzing and synthesizing information. As Roberts & Roberts (2010) describe in *The Dissertation Journey*, analysis is like describing the trees, while synthesis is describing the forest. In my data work, I try to practice both — seeing the details and the bigger picture.

Some of my small data visualization projects are published on Tableau Public here:

## Beyond Teaching and Research

Setting teaching and research aside, I spend much of my personal time reading economic and political news and following financial and stock markets.

I enjoy hiking and skiing. Living in Vancouver for about nine years has drawn me close to the mountains, and being surrounded by them naturally led me to explore hiking and learn skiing. Some of my favorite moments have been at Grouse Mountain and Watersprite Lake.

I also enjoy traveling and have traveled to 15 countries across three continents — America, Europe, and Asia.
