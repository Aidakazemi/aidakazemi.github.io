## Research Philosophy

Teaching has always reminded me how deeply a good educator can shape a person’s life — not only academically, but in confidence, direction, and purpose. I have personally experienced how meaningful teaching can reshape thinking and open new paths. That belief is the foundation of my research.

My work focuses on understanding how we can design better learning experiences, improve engagement, and support more effective and responsible use of new technologies in education and society. I aim for research that is both thoughtful and practical — work that educators and institutions can actually use.

## Research Area — Teaching, Pedagogy, and Learning Design

One major part of my research examines teaching pedagogy and andragogy — how people learn, how instructors facilitate learning, and how classroom design influences engagement and outcomes.

My work in this area includes:

- blended learning approaches  
- experiential learning models  
- active learning methods  
- facilitation techniques in adult education  

### Active Learning Spaces and FLEX Classrooms

I have been studying the impact of active learning classroom environments on teaching and learning experience. This work is connected to FLEX classroom redesign initiatives at Yorkville University, where classrooms were intentionally redesigned to support interaction and engagement.

In 2024, I received the **Support for Scholarly Activity Award** from Yorkville University to continue research on how these redesigned active learning spaces affect student engagement and instructional effectiveness.

## Research Area — Generative AI and Its Impact

Another core research direction in my work is the impact of Generative AI and recent advances in AI systems across multiple domains.

I study how Generative AI influences:

### Teaching and Education
- AI use in learning and assessment  
- responsible and ethical AI integration  
- how AI tools change instructional practice  

### Labor Market and Occupations
- how AI affects labor market
- occupational exposure to Generative AI  
- empirical measurement of AI impact on work  

### Unrepresented Creators and Policy
- training data ethics and consent  
- risks to independent and unrepresented creators  
- gaps in current policy frameworks  
- ethical and legal safeguards  

Several working papers across these areas are currently in progress and under development for publication.

## Ongoing Work

My current and ongoing projects include:

- Generative AI exposure and occupational impact modeling  
- AI ethics and creator protection frameworks  
- evaluation of active learning classroom environments  
- teaching and learning innovation in technology-supported settings
