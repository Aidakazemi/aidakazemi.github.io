My scholarly activity brings together research, teaching innovation, applied educational design, and academic service. My work is shaped by both my academic background and my lived experience as a learner and educator. I focus on producing work that is thoughtful, practical, and meaningful for students, institutions, and society.

## Research Philosophy

Teaching has always reminded me how deeply a good educator can shape a person’s life — not only academically, but in confidence, direction, and purpose. I have personally experienced how meaningful teaching can reshape thinking and open new paths. That belief is the foundation of my research and scholarly work.

My work focuses on understanding how we can design better learning experiences, improve engagement, and support more effective and responsible use of new technologies in education and society. I aim for scholarship that is both rigorous and usable in real educational settings.

## Research Areas

### Teaching, Pedagogy, and Learning Design

A major part of my research examines pedagogy and andragogy — how people learn, how instructors facilitate learning, and how classroom design influences engagement and outcomes.

My work in this area includes:

- blended learning approaches  
- experiential learning models  
- active learning methods  
- facilitation techniques in adult education  

#### Active Learning Spaces and FLEX Classrooms

I study the impact of active learning classroom environments on teaching and learning experience. This work is connected to FLEX classroom redesign initiatives at Yorkville University, where classrooms were intentionally redesigned to support interaction and engagement.

In 2024, I received the Support for Scholarly Activity Award from Yorkville University to continue research on how redesigned active learning spaces affect student engagement and instructional effectiveness.

### Generative AI and Its Impact

Another major research direction connects my economics and business background with technological change. My training in economics shaped how I analyze behavior, incentives, and decision systems, which naturally led me to study the impact of Generative AI and recent AI advances across multiple domains.

I study how Generative AI influences:

Teaching and Education:
- AI use in learning and assessment  
- responsible and ethical AI integration  
- how AI tools change instructional practice  

Labor Market and Occupations:
- how AI affects labor markets  
- occupational exposure to Generative AI  
- empirical measurement of AI impact on work  

Unrepresented Creators and Policy:
- training data ethics and consent  
- risks to independent and unrepresented creators  
- gaps in current policy frameworks  
- ethical and legal safeguards  

Several working papers across these areas are currently in progress and under development.

### Financial Literacy and Personal Finance Education

Another growing area of my scholarly interest is financial literacy education and personal finance. This interest is rooted in my personal experience exploring financial decision-making across the life span and observing how financial knowledge shapes long-term outcomes.

Through personal experimentation, study, and applied analysis, this area has developed into a research direction focused on improving financial literacy and rational financial decision-making.

### Simulation-Based Learning Innovation

I was among three faculty members who piloted the PRAXAR simulation at University Canada West for the MBA course Business Ethics, CSR, and Business Environment Analysis. The simulation enabled students to assume organizational roles, make team decisions, and evaluate outcomes using the ESGE framework.

### Faculty Mentorship

I mentored new faculty members at both University Canada West and Yorkville University through the Center for Teaching Excellence. This included onboarding support, curriculum alignment, and classroom observation over structured mentorship periods to support instructional quality.

---

### Graduate Supervision

I supervised two MBA students on their master’s research projects at University Canada West. Their projects received top evaluations from the research committee.

---

### Academic Governance

I serve as a Senate Member at Yorkville University’s BC campus, contributing to academic governance and strategic academic planning.

---

### Course Redevelopment and Curriculum Work

I have served on course redevelopment committees for both undergraduate and graduate courses, including:
